# X3 GPS Tracker ‚Äì Custom Feature Development
This project involved developing and extending features for the X3 GPS tracker, a device used in vehicle tracking and security systems. Similar to the GT06 project, this version was adapted to the hardware and protocol of the X3 tracker, enabling enhanced remote control and alert functionality via SMS commands.

# üîß Project Overview
The X3 GPS tracker is designed for real-time vehicle tracking. In this project, I customized its firmware to add advanced control features, such as remote door lock/unlock and alarm activation, triggered through mobile SMS.

These features aimed to improve the security and manageability of vehicles in both personal and commercial applications.

# üõ†Ô∏è My Contributions
* Adapted firmware features from GT06 to the X3 GPS tracker hardware

* Implemented remote door lock/unlock via SMS commands

* Designed logic for triggering alarms based on door access

* Ensured compatibility with the X3 protocol and electrical interfaces

* Conducted testing in real vehicles for reliability and performance

# üí° Features Implemented
* Remote control of door locks via SMS messages
  
* Door-based alarm activation

* SMS notifications for door access events

* Real-time communication and control over GSM network

* Integration with relay-based vehicle locking systems

# üß∞ Tools & Technologies
* Embedded C for firmware development

* SMS/GSM protocol handling specific to X3 GPS tracker

* Electrical interfacing with vehicle door lock and alarm systems

* Field testing in real conditions

# üöÄ Project Outcome
The X3 GPS tracker was successfully customized and deployed with the new features. It now provides technicians and users with the ability to remotely control vehicle doors, monitor activity, and receive instant alerts ‚Äî all through simple and secure SMS commands.
